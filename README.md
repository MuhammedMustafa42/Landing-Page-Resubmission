# Landing Page Project

1-Created a dynamic navigation bar that is based on the sections of the page
with the functionality to add more link items (li) when there is a new section
added to the HTML file.

2-Added to the navigation bar the ability to be hidden while not scrolling.

3-Added an active state to both the section in view (given the class="your-active-class")
and the proper link item in the navigation bar (given the class="highlight")

4-added the functionality to scroll to the selected section from the navigation bar.

5-added a scroll to top button in the right bottom of the screen that only is shown
when reaching a specific point while scrolling down.

6-added responsiveness to the page to be able to change the design of the navigation
bar when viewed in other devices.
